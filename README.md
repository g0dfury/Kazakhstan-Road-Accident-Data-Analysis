# Description.
The "Kazakhstan Road Accident Data Analysis" repository hosts a detailed examination of road accident data from various regions of Kazakhstan. It provides insights into accident patterns, contributing factors, and trends within the country. The repository contains meticulously collected datasets sourced from authoritative sources including the Kazakhstan Department of Transportation and law enforcement agencies. These datasets encompass a wide array of variables such as date, time, location, road conditions, vehicle types, and accident severity. Through thorough preprocessing techniques, the data is cleaned, formatted, and organized to ensure its suitability for analysis. The repository's primary focus lies in conducting exploratory data analyses to unveil significant patterns and trends in road accidents, offering valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers to enhance road safety measures.
